<p>Recently there have been some changes in my Backpack concerning the portable system that I carry with myself to perform my job. 
I have had an HP laptop handed to me on my first day of work at my current company (about two years ago) and I actually had no problems
whatsoever at the start. Now this Laptop lived for about 3/4 years before it decided to stop working. My Laptop would not turn on and I could not work for 1.5 days
cause we had no spare laptops at the time.</p>

<p>Now that was a bummer.. My company replaced my system with the same model and since I actually liked the Laptop I was handed in the first
place I was excited to have another one of these. Another 3/4 years down the line the exact same thing happens. Again I‚Äôm unable to work for 1.5 days before my replacement arrives. Again it is the same model. Then I learned something interessting. My company does BYOD (Bring your own device) and they actually pay for that system. But as, almost, always with cool stuff there is a hook. The laptop my company hands out have a 2 year lease on them before you can have a new one. Very reasonable policy in my eyes and also I thought at the time that my lease would soon expire and I could order a new one.</p>

<p>No‚Ä¶</p>

<p>As I learned a little while after receiving my 3rd laptop (still same modell) I found out that my lease was reset both times I received a replacement and I thought that I would be stuck in an endless HP Laptop loop, where I would get a new one every 3/4 years.</p>

<p>Now I‚Äôm in luck that I have good people above me that allowed me to ditch that HP misery (Not at all implying that‚Äôs the case for every HP Laptop!) and order myself my own System to be able to work on that. So I started thinking what I would like to use. It would have to perform well since I do developmemt on it and I also am fond of big and nice screens, since I work in a different spot nearly every day and I don‚Äôt always have the possibility for external screens. Ah and I code Powershell.</p>

<p>Could I buy myself a Macbook and have a good time working on it mostly writing Powershell code? Powershell 7 is around the edge and crossplatform is available since v6 so that is kind of covered. VSCode is available.. What do I need more? Honestly I tried to inform myself to the best I could, but soon it got clear to me that I was going to get a Macbook.</p>

<p>At the time I write this I have worked on my Macbook for one week now and I have to say I love it! I have noticed no shortcomings up until now and I have done some cool linux stuff on my machine! I have a Linux ansible lab on my Macbook for example. But the main thing I discovered for me this past few weeks was Docker.</p>

<p>I know I‚Äôm late to the part, but I started to look at it and play around with it. My main interesst was actually to run Powershell on linux and see how that‚Äôs working out. But then it hit me. Run Pester tests on docker machines with powershell on them. You can completly destroy your container and there will be a new one up and running in a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>I know it‚Äôs a simple idea and I by no means think for a second, that I‚Äôm the first one to come up with this, but still. So I started to write a Module.</p>

<p>In this Blogpost you‚Äôll learn how to run the Pester tests for your Powershell project on multiple operating systems locally.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bateskevin/DockerPester">DockerPester</a> makes this possible.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-do-this">What you need to do this</h2>

<p>there are a few prerequisites you should install to use</p>

<h3 id="docker-">Docker <img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5bfe78fe9d5abb94164ed3af/5c0f8b3c4fa51a03ef54a96b/5c112c188a922d6c219dcad6/1556553088561/docker-whale.png?format=1500w" alt="DockerLogo" height="50px" width="50px" /></h3>

<p>Docker is a containerization software that let‚Äôs you run containers on your machine.</p>

<p>Install it on your platform. It is available for Linux, MacOS and Windows here: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/?overlay=onboarding">Download Docker</a></p>

<h3 id="docker-context">Docker Context</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm by no means a specialist when it comes to docker. Actually I only just started with docker myself, but one of
the things I learned about it, is that you can pull docker images only if they fit the architecture of your OS.</p>

<p>So standardwise you will not be able to run a Linux container on your Windows machine of vice versa. On your Mac
you will be able to run Linux containers, but not Windows Containers.</p>

<h3 id="switch-context-on-windows">Switch Context on Windows</h3>

<p>On Docker for Windows you can switch your Context once you‚Äôre running Docker Desktop very easily.</p>

<p>Click the Arrow up in right bottom corner:</p>

<p><img src="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/images/whale-icon-systray-hidden.png" alt="arrow" /></p>

<p>And then Switch the Context by Clicking on ‚ÄòSwitch to Winows Containers‚Äô or ‚ÄòSwitch to Linux Containers‚Äô if Windows is already active:</p>

<p><img src="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/images/docker-menu-settings.png" alt="arrow" /></p>

<p>This is how you switch between linux and windows containers on Windows.</p>

<h3 id="switch-context-on-mac">Switch Context on Mac</h3>

<p>There is a possibility to add a Windows docker Context on MacOS.</p>

<p>I will not describe this in detail in this blog post, since it‚Äôs already documented very well on Github by Stefan Scherer Here:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/windows-docker-machine#working-on-macos">Add Docker Windows Context on MacOS</a></p>

<p>If you follow this documentation you will have a Windows Context called ‚Äú2019-box‚Äù</p>

<h1 id="dockerpester">DockerPester</h1>

<p>Ok so now you should have installed Docker on your machine, which makes you ready to use DockerPester.</p>

<h2 id="installing-dockerpester">Installing DockerPester</h2>

<p>The Module is currently not available on the Gallery. So at the moment the only option of using it you have is to fork and clone the repo.</p>

<h2 id="first-run-of-dockerpester">First run of DockerPester</h2>

<p>So to start off you just need a Powershell Project of yours with some Pester Tests. Create a Hashtable that 
contains the following Key Value pairs:</p>

<p>Each Parameter we define in the hashtable is shortly described with a comment on the same line. Make sure you‚Äôre in the right context for the Image you define here and the Executor matches your OS. Also make sure to change the ‚ÄòInputFolder‚Äô to an actual project with Pestertests in them. ‚ÄòPathToTests‚Äô is the Path in your Powershell Project Folder where your Tests are located.</p>

<p>To run your first DockerPester run use the following code:</p>

<figure class="highlight">
  <pre><code class="language-powershell" data-lang="powershell"><span class="nf">Invoke-DockerPester</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">@</span><span class="nx">ParamSet</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>So here we basically just splat the Parameters we defined in the Hash $ParamSet to ‚ÄòInvoke-DockerPester‚Äô.</p>

<p>So what will that do. First it will spin up a Container with the Image we defined in our Hash. The ContainerName we set will be the name of that container. Then it will copy the Powershell Module Project Folder from your local Computer that you defined under ‚ÄòInputFolder‚Äô to the path you defined in ‚ÄòPathOnContainer‚Äô on the Container. After that it will start downloading the Prerequisite modules that you defined to download from the gallery and it will install the newest version of Pester and yes, the output on that is not sooooooo nice I will admit that, but hey, we all need room to grow right?</p>

<p>After the installation of the modules it will start executing the Pester Tests. And when that‚Äôs done it will return the Passthru Object from Pester back to you.</p>

<p>The Output you will see should look like this:</p>

<p>If you want to save the PassThru Object of your Tests to a variable use the following Code:</p>

<figure class="highlight">
  <pre><code class="language-powershell" data-lang="powershell"><span class="nv">$PassThru</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">Invoke-DockerPester</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">@</span><span class="nx">ParamSet</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>In there you will find all the filled Properties of your standart PassThru Object from Pester.</p>

<h1 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h1>

<p>I had an HP laptop breaking all the time that pushed me to buy a Macbook for my Powershell job. That in exchange pushed me to try out some stuff on Linux which broadens my skillset and I found out I actually really like it! This brought me to docker and I had a lot of fun writing that module, which is far from finished :)</p>

<p>Docker is awesome, Powershell is awesome!</p>

<p>You can run Pester Tests in a docker container and retrieve the Passthru Object with <a href="https://github.com/bateskevin/DockerPester">DockerPester</a>.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
